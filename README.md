Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Syed Muhammad Daniyal**, a BS Computational Finance student passionate about bridging the gap between finance, mathematics, and technology.<br>
<br>
Currently, I'm exploring how to practically apply core concepts of **financial modeling**, **quantitative analysis**, and **risk management** using Python. My areas of interest include:<br>
<br>
ðŸ“Œ Financial Risk Management<br>
ðŸ“Œ Asset & Investment Management<br>
ðŸ“Œ Applied Financial Mathematics<br>
ðŸ“Œ Data-Driven Portfolio Strategies<br>
ðŸ“Œ Machine Learning in Finance<br>
<br>
On this GitHub, you'll find projects where I combine my analytical background with programming tools like `pandas`, `yfinance`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy` to simulate strategies, backtest portfolios, and visualize financial insights.<br>
<br>
I'm driven by curiosity, clarity, and continuous learning â€” always looking to contribute meaningfully and collaborate on projects that solve real-world problems in finance or fintech.<br>
